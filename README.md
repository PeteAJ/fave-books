Sinatra Project

# Fave Books 

My sinatra project is a way to keep and maintain a list of all your favorite books. I thought this might be useful because it'd be a way to suggest titles to friends and also weed through books that you do not want so they can be sold or given away.  

Fave Books includes user authentication where you can login or signup with an email and password. I utilized readers and books controllers and crud routes whereby you can create and modify book titles, etc. as well as log in users or readers.  

The next steps for this project include hammering down some of the functionality and a join table so multiple readers can use the site and keep track of similar or identical titles.
